# GoogleCybersecurity
This Git repository holds my Google Cybersecurity portfolio projects.

I am interested in Cybersecurity due to its growth and the amount of unknowns there are in terms of vulnerabilities. As there is a constant need to reduce problems and protect people and valuable assets, I am intrigued to learn more about what is needed to do so. I have experience in Python, SQL, and R, so the programming aspect is something I look to improve. With a specific focus in Cybersecurity, I would be able to tailor my problem solving skills to adjust to real life situations. I am intrigued with how we use automation to be more efficient and prioritize other tasks, so I would love to learn more through new learning experiences.
